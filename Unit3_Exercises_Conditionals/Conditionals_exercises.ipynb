For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle: If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, then you cannot form a triangle. Otherwise, you can. (If the sum of two lengths equals the third, they form what is called a \u201cdegenerate\u201d triangle.)"
